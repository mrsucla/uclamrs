                        <p>Research in the Dunn group involves the synthesis of inorganic and hybrid materials and characterization of their electrical and optical properties. One of the principal themes which extends to most of the research activities is the use of sol-gel methods to synthesize a number of the materials studied in the group. This synthetic approach enables the preparation of materials that incorporate a wide variety of organic and biological dopants and are capable of developing unique microstructures and properties. <br>
                        This remote research opportunity has to do with analyzing optical images and will be taken as MSE 99. Please contact Dr. Dunn once fall quarter instruction begins.

                        <p>Our group focuses on the science underlying the synthesis and stability of advanced materials for applications in the areas of aerospace, catalysis, energy storage, and optoelectronics industries. We aim to develop detailed atomic-level understanding of the mass transport mechanisms, chemical reaction kinetics, and material thermodynamics controlling morphological, compositional, and structural evolution of materials. We use a variety of in situ (as well as ex situ) characterization tools such as variable-temperature scanning probe microscopy (STM/AFM), low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM), scanning/transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to investigate the kinetics of nucleation, growth, and thermochemical and mechanical stabilities of nanostructures. <br>

                        This research opportunity involves using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in the spectra of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy from biological or patient samples for cancer detection or Covid-19 detection. This will be best suited for people with statistics and software backgrounds.

                        <p>Dr. Raman’s research explores how light and heat can be controlled at the nanoscale to enable new technological possibilities for cleaner energy, information processing, sensing, displays and communication systems. His research group’s interdisciplinary interests include metamaterials, nanophotonics, photonic materials, plasmonics and new computational and machine learning methods. A highlight of his recent work has been initiating an emerging field of research, and a new approach to energy efficiency and generation, known as radiative cooling. Using nanoscale photonic materials, his research has explored how to harness a ubiquitous and renewable source of energy that remains largely unexploited: the cold of the universe. </p>

Their efforts go toward creating a science base in quantitative relations between the microstructural parameters and macroscopic mechanical response of high temperature composites. Experimental and theoretical work is conducted to study the significant issues on mechanisms and mechanics of deformation and fracture of high temperature composites.</p>

                        <p>I am interested in the development and usage of mathematical and computational tools for the characterization and informed discovery of novel materials and structures, with a particular focus on first principles (i.e., quantum mechanical) methods. I have been working on extending the scope and capabilities of such methods, for applications to problems in mechanics (such as the modeling of defects), and energy storage / conversion technologies. My other research interests include the analysis and development of multiscale methods; the usage of symmetry principles in various areas of science and engineering (including problems related to materials discovery, molecular self-assembly, wave-propagation, and the design of computational solvers); as well as numerical analysis and scientific computation. </p>
